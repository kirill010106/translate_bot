# Translate bot
## Current bot is based on YandexCloud Translate paid API
### Main target of this project is just to learn more about *aiogram* and *aiogram-dialog* modules
### However, this project has a useful functionality (at least till 22, June 2024)
### Main used libraries:
* *aiogram*
* *aiogram-dialog*
* *requests*
* *sqlite3*
* *environs*
* *redis* (included but not really seriously used)

### For usage don't forget to add *.env* file in root folder with parameters mentioned in .env.example

##### Special thanks to *Tishka17*, the developer of aiogram-dialog library
